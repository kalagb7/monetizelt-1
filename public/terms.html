        <h3>3.3 Account Security</h3>

        <h2>4. ROLE OF MONETIZELT</h2>
        <p>Monetizelt acts solely as a technical and commercial intermediary between Sellers and Buyers. We:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Host and deliver Sellers’ digital products;</li>
            <li>Manage payments via third-party partners (e.g., PayPal);</li>
            <li>Provide analytics and revenue dashboards;</li>
            <li>Ensure transaction security and data protection.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Monetizelt is not a party to the sales contract and does not guarantee the quality, legality, or suitability
            of products.</p>

        <h2>5. SALES AND PURCHASE PROCESS</h2>
        <h3>5.1 For Buyers</h3>
        <p>No account is required. Purchases are made using a valid email address. After successful payment, a unique,
            non-transferable access link is generated. Access is limited to the device used for the purchase and valid
            only for the displayed duration.</p>

        <h3>5.2 For Sellers</h3>
        <p>Sellers may publish content available online for up to 7 days, renewable. Sales and earnings statistics are
            accessible from the Seller Dashboard.</p>

        <h2>6. COMMISSIONS, PAYMENTS, WITHDRAWALS, AND TAXES</h2>
        <h3>6.1 Platform Commission</h3>
        <p>Commissions (PayPal) are deducted automatically prior to payout - Monetizelt charges a 12% commission on each
            sale. The remaining 88% is credited to the Seller’s balance.</p>

        <h3>6.2 Payment Fees</h3>
        <p>All payments are processed via PayPal, subject to PayPal’s standard fees (3.49% + $0.49).</p>

        <h3>6.3 Withdrawals</h3>
        <p>Withdrawals are available from $10, processed weekly on Fridays (UTC). 'Each withdrawal carries a fixed fee
            of $0.25' Monetizelt is not liable for losses caused by incorrect PayPal addresses or account deletion
            before payout.</p>

        <h3>6.4 Refund Policy</h3>
        <p>All sales of digital products are final once the access link has been issued. In case of technical failure,
            Monetizelt may review refund requests, without any automatic guarantee.</p>
